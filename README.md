# -Time2Date---Spacetime--
Time to Date is a program to convert from GPS time (expressed in either integer or hex) to a month/day/year, hour, minute, second.   This program does not automatically adjust for leap seconds, however the offset field could be used for that purpose.   If you want to find UTC in 2022,  you can enter -18 in the offset field and perform a num to date conversion.    The program will also convert GPS time expressed in month/day/year, hour, minute, second) back to integer and hex.
